This list should cover the clear typographical errors. There are also some areas with inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "ZeRO" vs "Zero-3" vs "Zero") or US/UK spelling variations ("optimiser" vs "optimizer", "parallelise" vs "parallelize", "neighbour" vs "neighbor") which I've mostly standardized towards US English based on prevailing usage in the document, unless the UK spelling was clearly intentional or in a direct quote/name. Punctuation in lists is also frequently missing, but I've focused on word-level errors per the request.
