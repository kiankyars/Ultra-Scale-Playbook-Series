## Video Transcript
```
Okay, so welcome back to the ultras scale playback series reporting to you live from the sauna. And as we covered the parallel programming crash course appendix last video, we can now jump straight into data parallelism. And to remind you, what we're doing is we're replicating the model on several GPUs, which we call model instances. And we run forward and backward passes on different micro batches of data in parallel for each GPU. And this is why it's called data parallelism. The data is flowing in a parallel way. And in this example which you've seen in the previous video, we have three GPUs that are doing the forward and backward pass on the model simultaneously. And then the real crux of this uh of this sophistication is these three arrows because this needs to be combined in what we call an all reduced step. So of course when you have the arrows it looks when you have the arrows it looks trivial but in practice there are many ways to have a unoptimized implementation. So this is very important to pay attention to. Let's see what it says here. Using a different microbatch for each GPU means we'll have different gradients in each GPU. So to keep the model instances in sync across different GPUs. The gradients will be averaged using an operation operation called all reduce. And this happens during the backward pass before the optimizer step. So as it said here when we finish the last backward pass we perform all reduce to synchronize the gradients and then we will update the gradients across the GPUs for the next forward pass which continues on and on. So this is the first distributed communication primitive that we actually introduced within the series once again. and it handles the communication and synchronization between GPU instances and nodes. One thing which confused me for a really long time. So maybe you've had this problem as well is that this graph here only is showing one GPU. So what I first believe that this was describing is the GPU 0 1 and two which doesn't make sense because that means that it is doing it sequentially which defeats the entire purpose of par parallelism but after talking with GPT with this at least the only explanation that makes sense is that we have a three layer neural network for example on each GPU so the GPU 01 and two will do the three forward passes and then backward through the three layers in reverse order and then in this step it's synchronizing across all three GPUs. Just please note that this is not the device index but rather the layer for each GPU. And what they're saying here is that a naive data parallelism implementation would wait for the backward pass the last backward pass to finish or the last backward layers finished and the entire backward pass so that we can synchronize and average with all reduce. However, this is a big no because we don't want our GPUs to stay idle while communication is happening like on the above graph, which means that in our computation um timeline once the communication is begun, we are wasting our GPUs on a lot of idle time before the optimizer kicks in and updates the gradients, which is as we can tell very unoptimal. Okay. And now we're going to go through three optimization strategies in this video to improve from this naive implementation that we'll build iteratively from each other. So the first one is called overlap gradient synchronization with backward pass and it's maybe the first thing that would come to your mind intuitively. So the naive um distributed data parallelism approach that we're using is naive because we have to wait for gradient synchronization before updating the parameters. But what we're asking here is can we overlap this communication with our computation? And the answer is yes. So for example as soon as the backward path of the last layer is complete which is this layer here. I'm not sure why it's saying last box on the right. It's kind of confusing. There are a few typos in this playbook. So that's worth noting that some things you have to doubt their meaning. Anyways, as soon as this is complete, those gains can already be gathered and summed while the backward computations continue for earlier layers moving toward the left. So once again, when we do the backward for early layers, we're actually moving to the right. So perhaps I'm mistaken here, but that's my understanding. In essence, we can start even before the backward pass is done through the last layer of the model. And this is because I suppose yeah as soon as we start computing values every time essentially we call backward we can begin to communicate these to the other GPUs and reduce them and reduce just means sum them up and then average them out. So this can be achieved in PyTorch by attaching an all reduce hook function to each parameter. And this approach overlaps most of the all reduce operations within the gradient calculations which is to say within the GPU computation thereby improving efficiency. And so that means that this idle time is much shorter than this idle time. Even though like in this diagram it's the same length. Of course in actuality having to calculate or having to synchronize only like two 1/3 of the middle layer and the entire first layer instead of all three layers will all be will evidently be faster. Okay. And this is just the simple hook to register all of the parameters that require gradients. And that's why we have if P requires red is true. And we just put this parameter. We add this hooks parameter such that it will perform an all reduce every time that we call the backward function. In summary, overlapping computation communication reduces the time spent waiting for gradient synchronization across the entire model and gradient synchronization can occur at least partially in parallel with the backward pass which means that we can combine computation and communication which will significantly speed up data parallelism. GPT was quoting like 1.36x speed up which is non-trivial. And there are also these implementations in pictoron but for this video I'm going to skip that. Feel free to go to the website and interact with these because with the PDF of course this is not interactable and so this is a example of overlapping communication communication computation and communication sorry but this will be discussed more and more as it is an an essential technique to maximal scaling efficiency now let's move on to the second of three optimizations which is called bucketing gradients and this one is definitely more intuitive so GPU operations are usually more efficient when performed on large tensors rather than having many operations run on small tensors this is also true for communication thus we can advantageously group gradients into buckets and launch a single all reduce for all the gradients within the same bucket and each bucket being a layer of the model instead of performing independent all reduce for each gradient which is this case. So for each gradient we're performing all reduce. Here we're doing it within the bucket. And you can see it's kind of like a Lego piece that's just shifted by one block because of course since we're waiting for the entire bucket we need to have the entire gradient calculation completed for the backward pass on layer 2 before we can begin to all reduce and communicate through the three GPUs. At least if we use the same example as before and they have an excellent analogy here. So it says think of it like packing items into boxes before shipping. It's more efficient to send a few big boxes and many small ones. By performing a single all reduce operation for each bucket, we can significantly reduce communication overhead and speed up the communication operation. So pretty intuitive. And if you're once again interested in seeing more, you can check out the bucket DP implementation in Picotron. The third and last optimization isn't as obvious because we're actually adding something. So we initially added data parallelism in order to mimic gradient accumulation or rather have gradient accumulation happening parallelly, right? Because when we do gradient accumulation on a single GPU, this means that we have to do one batch, second batch, third batch, and then optimize. But if we have it on three GPUs, we do three batches simultaneously and then all reduce and then optimize. But what if we add gradient accumulation to essentially get more free lunch? So as an example, you'd have three GPUs each running three batches and then after three batches, you would all reduce. So GPU 1 does three batches, GPU 2 does three batches, GPU 3 does uh three batches. So nine batches in total and then after every GPU is in the third batch we will do the optimizer step and there's a very naive problem here which would occur if you instead of performing the all reduce after the three GPUs after the three batches do it after every batch. So this is to say the naive implementation would say okay each GPU is first batch now let's all reduce the gradients at everything. Now we do the second batch on the three GPUs all reduce and the third batch all reduce. This is completely unnecessary because what you can instead do is since you only need the gradients during the optimizer step which is after three batches you'll simply sum up within the GPUs. So no communication required only computation and no idle time. You'll sum up the gradients for the three batches and then perform the all reduce. And this is honestly kind of obvious like why would you essentially consolidate between every batch when you only need it at the end during the optimizer step. So I think I just went through exactly what is highlighted here. And then our last note before I end the video today is that when performing communication operations, tensors must be contiguous in memory to avoid redundant memory copies. And contiguous means literally side by side. So if you think of memory as a grid, contiguous means that you can have one pointer at the beginning of the tensor and then the rest of the I guess elements in the tensor or parameters will all be sequential. And what this means is that you don't need to have pointers pointing to all of the different points in memory. uh like with a normal array you would have to have one piece for the data and then one piece for the pointer because it's not continuous but when it is contiguous you only need one pointer at the start and then you can just literally add one bite to get to the next data point in that tensor. So we need to have this happen. So in order to facilitate this we often pre-allocate continuous buffers of the size of activations or model parameters specifically for communication. While this speeds up communication another typo here if you're aware anyways it also contributes in part to peak memory training. But of course, if we have to pre-allocate this memory, then because of this, we're going to have to have a little more memory usage instead of instantiating memory when we need it, but instead of having to like search for it in memory and lead to a less efficient memory structure. And furthermore, this also tells you why we need to know the exact activation requirement. So, if you've watched episode one, it gives you the formula at least for a transformer of knowing given the amount of parameters. Sorry. Yeah, given the size of the transformer, how much activation memory is required during the training step? And if we know this, then we can better optimize our memory allocation at the beginning of the training run. So there you have it for our video about the three optimization steps in data parallelism. Tune in for episode 5.
